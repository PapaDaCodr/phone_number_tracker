where `<phone_number>` is the phone number that you want to track.

The script will then print the latitude and longitude of the phone number to the console.
## Accuracy

The accuracy of the location will depend on the number and quality of the cell tower signals that are available. In general, the more cell towers that are available, the more accurate the location will be.
